# MIPS-Processor
This processor has been implemented using Verilog as a hardware description language.
You can use ModelSim software for running Verilog codes. ModelSim is a package in Mentor Graphics and is used for logic simulation of HDLs.You can get more information about how this processor works by reading the MIPS_Processor_Project.pdf and MIPS_Processor_Demo.pdf files.

## Usage guide

### Requirements
* ModelSim (HLDs Simulator). See [ModelSim setup guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4vszqOYygMYjq6mFfSxgh45EyVWbCaI/view?usp=sharing)

### Step 1: Download Velilog Codes & Instructions File
You can clone codes using the below command:
```
git clone https://github.com/SaraBaradaran/MIPS-Processor
```

### Step 2: Run Codes Using ModelSim
